- This App displays a list of breeds and their detailed view, obtained from an API using URLSession.
- UI has a searchable text field, which allows users to filter breeds by name.
- Breed data is retrieved with pagination, which ensures better performance of the app, loading data partialy.
- The architechture used in this project is MVVM.
- This project also abstracts Data Ma00nage, therefore we can find a DataManager which fullfills Repository Pattern requirements.
- Its interface is implemented using SwiftUI, which ensures a reactive response.
- The app uses Kingfisher third party library,to manage images.
- Third party libraries are handled using Cocoapods.
